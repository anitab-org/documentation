Here are some guidelines for ambassadors for design to follow when collaborating on projects:

1.) Clearly define roles and responsibilities: Make sure everyone knows what is expected of them and how their contributions fit into the overall project.

2.) Communicate effectively: Keep lines of communication open and make sure everyone is on the same page. Use tools like Slack, Trello, or Google Docs to stay organized and keep track of progress.

3.) Respect each other's time: Set clear deadlines and stick to them. If something comes up that will prevent you from meeting a deadline, let the team know as soon as possible.

4.) Seek feedback: Encourage open and honest communication. Be open to constructive criticism and be willing to make changes based on feedback from your team members.

5.) Be flexible: Things don't always go as planned, so be willing to adapt and pivot when necessary.

6.) Take breaks: Collaboration can be demanding, so make sure to take breaks and prioritize self-care.

7.) Have fun: Collaboration is an opportunity to learn from and work with others. Embrace the opportunity and enjoy the process!

8.) Celebrate successes: Don't forget to celebrate your team's accomplishments along the way! Whether it's a small win or a major milestone, take the time to recognize and appreciate the hard work of your team members.

9.) Be professional: Remember that you are representing the ambassador program and your work will be public-facing. Make sure to maintain a professional demeanor and uphold the standards and values of the program.

10.) Take ownership of your work: Be responsible for the quality and timeliness of your own contributions to the project. If you encounter any issues or challenges, be proactive in seeking out help and finding solutions.
