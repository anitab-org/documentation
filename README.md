# [About AnitaB.org](https://anitab.org/)
At AnitaB.org, we’re committed to increasing the influence of women on all aspects of technology. Our Local community expands our efforts globally to help individuals all over the world — especially those who are considering or currently pursuing technical careers — can access the resources they need to reach their highest potential.

Members of the global AnitaB.org Local community network organize events and provide one another with resources to navigate careers in tech. They organize valuable meetups, codeathons, and one-day HopperX1 events modeled after the Grace Hopper Celebration.
