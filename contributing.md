## Style Guides for Git Commit Messages:memo:
#### Here's a list of some good to have points, that can add more value to your contribution logs.

- Use the present tense (example: "Add feature" and not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood (example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called subject line) to 50 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what, why, vs, and how
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

For more detailed reference to the above points, refer here: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit.

## üí• Issues:
For major changes, you are welcomed to open an issue  about what you would like to contribute. Enhancements will be appreciated.

#### All the Best!ü•á

## General Guidelines

* If you‚Äôre just getting started work on an issue labeled ‚ÄúFirst Timers Only‚Äù in any project. Additional resources are available on our [website](http://www.systers.io).
* In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.
* After approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.
* Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If you‚Äôd like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues.
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
