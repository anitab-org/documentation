<h2>Issue Workflow</h2>

* Untriaged issues are checked for validity and triaged by project managers.
* During triage:
  * Label is set to `Status: Available` if the issue is valid.
  * Label is set to `Status: On Hold` if additional information or discussion id required regarding that issue.
  * Issue is closed if it is not valid.
  * At least one label from each of `Category` and `Type` should be set.
  * Label `First Timers Only` can be set if the issue has simple fix.
  * Label `Help Wanted` can be set if the issue has a higher priority to be fixed.
